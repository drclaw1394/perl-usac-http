uSAC::HTTP Micro Swiss Army Chainsaw Web server

=head1 SYNOPSIS


=head1 DESCRIPTION

uSAC::HTTP is a webserver implementing HTTP/1.1. It utilises persistant connections and a fast dispatching system to achieve solid performance in vanilla Perl with AnyEvent.

Your program can be sperated into multiple files, and grouped together in a syntax not unlike nginx config files. As each sub file is accessed relative to the current 'config' file, it is very easy to build up complex sites across multiple targed files.

Features include:

=item *Solid performance

=item *Declaritive structure

A uSAC program is made of only a few statments which are normal perl code, however have similarities with nginx config files

=item *Concise mapping

A single entry can specify a HTTP method , URL, fields to capture, middleware and target endpoint. Many of these are optional too.

=item *Simple static file, caching and middleware

Serving static files can be from multiple locations and just like any normal route.

=item *Streaming and block handling of form/uploads

Parameter parsing and uploads can either be processed after a complete upload, or you can process chunks as they arrive.
The callback structure is the same making it easy to do either
