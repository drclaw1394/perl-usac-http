=head1 NAME

uSAC::HTTP  - Event driven HTTP Server, Client and Middleware

=head1 DESCRIPTION

uSAC::HTTP is a web framework/web server currently implementing HTTP/1.1. It
utilises persistant connections, a fast dispatching system and aliasing  to
achieve solid performance.  

It's written to support multiple event systems, such as AnyEvent, IO Async, for
flexibility in deplyment.

This is a very quick overview of basic concepts of the what, how and why of the
system. Please refer to linked documents for details on  a topic.


=head1 CORE CONCEPTS

=head2 Using Perl BECAUSE it's Perl

=over

=item Perl is different from other languages

So why not program to the benefits it can bring? Strong regex support is an
obvious example of Perl power. However It also makes it straight foward to do
functional-ish programming. This really make writing middleware a joy, without
the forced object oriented convolution in almost every other framework.

=item Not everything needs to be an object

and perl is great for that.

=item Your keyboard enjoys terse code

Who wants to type more than is nessicary? Perl syntax make short work out or
chained code which is used extensivly in this module, all while allowing
comments. Let's do this.

=head2 Middleware Only (no app)

This the main processing unit for the user. Almost everything the user would
need to do is done via middleware. Any number of middleware can be chained
together. Each middleware has inner, outer and error phases.

=head2 Route

A route links a target url to a chain of middleware. Routes are searched in
order of addition and give the full power of perl regex if needed to match
against HTTP method, path and also supports captures.


=head2 Site

Sites are logical groupings of routes. A site can define default and shared
behaviour/middleware across any routes defined in the site. It also 'chains'
together prefixs so mounting sites within sites is very easy.


=head2 Delegate

A site my optionally have a Delegate, being an package name or object
reference. This give extra flexibilty in separating routing and middleware
chains across files and very quick creating of 'applications'.

=head2 Separation of Concerns, Code across multiple files, or not

How you structure your project is up to you. There is no 'template' to an
application. The server for example can, load routes, sites and route from any
file you like, which intern could have middleware defined in install packages,
or locally, in other files.  The Delegate feature could be used, and more
routes and middleware could also be stored there.

Or you could simply add everything to a single file. 

The flexibility is there for the user to choose.


=head1 Middleware Coding by Convention

Middleware and the internal parsing/serialisation intentionally avoids
signatures of subroutines where possible.

The middleware structure utilises the same arguments at each stage, so a
signature wastes cycles with data copies, it allow just requires more typing
for very little benefit.

The arguments are indexed with compile time constants, so they are still
'addressable by name',but removes runtime overhead associated with signatures
and argument copying.


=head1 Parameter aliasing

Tied in with the previous, buffers are reused with aliasing. 



=head2 Code (file) relative paths




=head1 Server

=head1 Client

=head1 Middleware





It is implemented using:


	AnyEvent IO watchers
	uSAC::SIO for Stream reading and writing 
	uSAC::MIME for mime type database

It implements a 'declarative', config file like, way of defining a web
server/framework, allowing single file and multifile applications to be
developed. 


Docuemtnation is scant at the moment, as it isn't quote ready for prime time.

=head1 Programming Style


The idea is OO heavy code is used during initialisation, while a more
functional approach is used during runtime. This saves on wasting time on
method lookups when you already know what you want.

In this spirit, setup code is prefixed with C<usac_>. These subroutines
generally return another subroutine which is actually executed during runtime.

For example C<usac_file_under> takes a directory as an argument and returns the
sub which is called as the endpoint of a route which will serve static files
from that directory
