=head1 NAME

uSAC::HTTP  - uSAC HTTP Server (and client eventually)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

uSAC::HTTP is a web framework/web server implementing HTTP/1.1. It utilises
persistant connections, a fast dispatching system and aliasing  to achieve solid
performance in vanilla Perl.  It is implemented using:

	AnyEvent IO watchers
	uSAC::SIO for Stream reading and writing 
	uSAC::MIME for mime type database

It implements a 'declarative', config file like, way of defining a web
server/framework, allowing single file and multifile applications to be
developed. 


Docuemtnation is scant at the moment, as it isn't quote ready for prime time.

=head1 Programming Style


The idea is OO heavy code is used during initialisation, while a more
functional approach is used during runtime. This saves on wasting time on
method lookups when you already know what you want.

In this spirit, setup code is prefixed with C<usac_>. These subroutines
generally return another subroutine which is actually executed during runtime.

For example C<usac_file_under> takes a directory as an argument and returns the
sub which is called as the endpoint of a route which will serve static files
from that directory
